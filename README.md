Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

Install dependencies in both the root and client directories:



cd mern-ecommerce
npm install

cd client
npm install

Set your environment variables. Add a .env file in the server directory with the following content:

dotenv
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
Replace your-mongodb-connection-string with your actual MongoDB connection string.

Start the development server:

npm run dev

This will start both the React frontend and Express backend. Access the application at http://localhost:3000.
